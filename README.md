These files create an interactive visualization of the MBTA map, and allow users to right click on a starting and ending node. The shortest path is then shown (unused edges are turned grey), and an estimated time is printed on the screen.

To deselect nodes, just left click anywhere on the screen.

All T information was obtained through the MBTA website.
